  <li>
    <p>You will be prompted for your meetup.com API key the first time. <strong><em>You will need to register a normal user account with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/register">meetup.com</a> to obtain a key.</em></strong>  This is only necessary the first time because the script will remember your key for any subsequent uses.</p>
