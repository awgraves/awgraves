## Pittsburgh, PA: A Place for Tech

After using my [python script]({{site.url}}/meetup-api-data/) to gather data on every registered meetup group in Pittsburgh, the first thing I wanted to know were the types of groups that were most popular.  There was one category that blew all the others out of the water...

With such a large and vibrant tech scene, the question then became: ***which groups are the "top" groups in the area?***

In order to answer this question we will need to choose the right metrics to define "top".  

## Membership Base

The most obvious place to begin is simply to see which groups have the most people:

Not bad!  Looks like the largest groups range between roughly 1,500 to 3,500 each.  Notice, however, that blah.

## Last Event's RSVP count

Here we go.

## Event Frequency

![first]({{site.url}}/assets/img/pgh_tech/event_freq_rank.png)

# Final Verdict:

By combining all three of our metrics we can compute an average score.
