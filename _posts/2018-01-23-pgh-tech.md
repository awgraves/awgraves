## Pittsburgh, PA: A Place for Tech

After using [my python script]({{site.url}}/meetup-api-data/) to generate a dataset on every registered meetup group in Pittsburgh, the first question I asked myself was: **what is the most popular meetup category?**  The data quite clearly indicate...

"Wow, Pittsburghers love their tech meetups!", I thought. 

"But wouldn't it be nice to know which of these 135 groups are the real 'pillars' of the meetup scene?"

So my question then became: ***How can we use the data to rank the groups by order of importance?***

Let's see...

## Starting with Membership Base

The most obvious place to begin is simply to see which groups have the most people:

Not bad!  It looks like the largest groups range between roughly 1,500 to 3,500 members each.  

However, looking over at the rsvp column, notice how large membership counts do not equal large event turnouts.

## RSVP Count Matters Too

The most thriving groups in the community should also have well-attended events, right?  Then let's sort the groups by their most recent event RSVP:

>NOTE: As any party host knows, RSVP counts hardly ever match actual turnout. But, since we are concerned with ***relative*** turnout between the groups, I would argue that RSVP count is still a sound metric for comparison.

Looks good...  
Wait!...one of the top groups by rsvp have only had 3 events in the past year!  I think any group we label as being "at the heart" of the tech scene should be a little more active, don't you?

## So, How Can We Measure 'Activity'?

This question is trickier than it first appears.

We have a column for ***past event counts*** and at first this might seem like a good way to find the most active groups.  However, what about newer groups that have not been around long enough?  Using past event count would be biased towards older (but not necessarily more 'active') groups.

We might also try ordering the groups by whoever had the most recent event, but this will not tell us ***how often*** events actually take place.

I think a good solution here is to calculate the ***average wait time*** between hosted events.  We can do this by taking the **age** of the group divided by the **number of past events**.

We now have a column ***event_freq*** with the average wait time measured in days.

# Pulling it All Together:

### We have decided on 3 dimensions to measure the importance of a group:
* Membership
* Most Recent RSVP Count
* Event Frequency

We want to rank the groups, so calculating **percentile scores** for each dimension will work well. (For example, a membership score of 90 means this group has more members than 90 percent of all other groups).

To calculate the final score we will simply average the scores for the 3 dimensions.
