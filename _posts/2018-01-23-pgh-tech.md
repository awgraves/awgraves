## Pittsburgh, PA: A Place for Tech

After using [my python script]({{site.url}}/meetup-api-data/) to generate a dataset on every registered meetup group in Pittsburgh, the first question I asked myself was: **what is the most popular meetup category?**  The data quite clearly indicate...

"Wow, Pittsburghers love their tech meetups!", I thought. 

"But wouldn't it be nice to know which of these 135 groups are the real 'pillars' of the meetup scene?"

So my question then became: ***How can we use the data to rank the groups by order of prominence?***

Let's see...  

<br>

## Starting with Membership Base

The most obvious place to begin is to see which groups have the most people:

![first]({{site.url}}/assets/img/pgh_tech/members_rank.png)

Not bad!  It looks like the largest groups range between roughly 1,500 to 3,500 members each.  
However, looking over at the rsvp column, notice how large membership counts do not equal large event turnouts.
<br>
## RSVP Count Matters Too

The most prominent groups in the community should also have well-attended events, right?  Then let's sort the groups by the RSVP count for their last hosted event:

>NOTE: As any party host knows, RSVP counts hardly ever match actual turnout. But, since we are concerned with ***relative*** turnout between the groups, I would argue it is still a sound metric for comparison.
 
Hmm...one of the top groups by rsvp has only had 3 events in the past year!  I think any group we label as being "at the heart" of the tech scene should be a little more active, don't you? So...
<br>
## How Do We Measure Activity?

This question is trickier than it first appears.

We have a column for ***past event counts*** that might initially seem like a straightforward solution.  However, using this as a comparison would give more weight to ***older*** (but not necessarily more ***active***) groups - think about a hypothetical group with 25 events spread over 100 years versus a new group with 10 events within its first 2 months!

We might also try ordering the groups by whoever had the most recent event, but this will not tell us ***how often*** events actually take place.

I think a good solution is to calculate the ***average wait time*** between hosted events.  We can do this by taking the **age** of the group divided by the **number of past events**.

We now have a column ***event_freq*** with the average wait time measured in days.  This is a much fairer way to compare old and new groups alike.

# Pulling it All Together:

### We have decided on 3 dimensions for our ranking system:
* Size of Membership Base
* Most Recent RSVP Count
* Event Frequency

Since we are ranking our groups, calculating **percentile scores** for each dimension seems appropriate.  
***For example, a membership score of 90 means this group has more members than 90 percent of all other groups.***

All that's left to do now is calculate the **mean** percentile score for each group across all dimensions and declare our winners.

*So...*
