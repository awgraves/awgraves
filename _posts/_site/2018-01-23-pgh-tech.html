<h2 id="pittsburgh-pa-a-place-for-tech">Pittsburgh, PA: A Place for Tech</h2>

<p>After using <a href="http://localhost:4000/meetup-api-data/">my python script</a> to generate a dataset on every registered meetup group in Pittsburgh, the first question I asked myself was: <strong>what is the most popular meetup category?</strong>  The data quite clearly indicate…
<br />

</p>

<br /></p>

<p>“Wow, Pittsburghers love their tech meetups!”, I thought.</p>

<p>“But wouldn’t it be nice to know which of these 135 groups are the real ‘pillars’ of the meetup scene?”</p>

<p>So my question then became: <strong><em>How can we use the data to rank the groups by order of importance?</em></strong></p>

<p>Let’s see…</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="starting-with-membership-base">Starting with Membership Base</h2>

<p>The most obvious place to begin is simply to see which groups have the most people:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/pgh_tech/members_rank.png" alt="first" /></p>

<p>Not bad!  It looks like the largest groups range between roughly 1,500 to 3,500 members each.<br />
However, looking over at the rsvp column, notice how large membership counts do not equal large event turnouts.
<br /></p>
<h2 id="rsvp-count-matters-too">RSVP Count Matters Too</h2>

<p>The most thriving groups in the community should also have well-attended events, right?  Then let’s sort the groups by the RSVP count for their last hosted event:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/pgh_tech/last_rsvp_rank.png" alt="first" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: As any party host knows, RSVP counts hardly ever match actual turnout. But, since we are concerned with <strong><em>relative</em></strong> turnout between the groups, I would argue it is still a sound metric for comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm…one of the top groups by rsvp has only had 3 events in the past year!  I think any group we label as being “at the heart” of the tech scene should be a little more active, don’t you? So…
<br /></p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-measure-activity">How Do We Measure Activity?</h2>

<p>This question is trickier than it first appears.</p>

<p>We have a column for <strong><em>past event counts</em></strong> that might initially seem like a straightforward way to find the most active groups.  However, using past event count would give more weight to <strong><em>older</em></strong> (but not necessarily more <strong><em>active</em></strong>) groups.  Think about a hypothetical group that has had 25 events over the last 100 years versus a group created last month with 5 events already!</p>

<p>We might also try ordering the groups by whoever had the most recent event, but this will not tell us <strong><em>how often</em></strong> events actually take place.</p>

<p>I think a good solution here is to calculate the <strong><em>average wait time</em></strong> between hosted events.  We can do this by taking the <strong>age</strong> of the group divided by the <strong>number of past events</strong>.</p>

<p>We now have a column <strong><em>event_freq</em></strong> with the average wait time measured in days.  This is a much fairer way to compare old and new groups alike.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-decided-on-3-dimensions-for-our-ranking-system">We have decided on 3 dimensions for our ranking system:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Size of Membership Base</li>
  <li>Most Recent RSVP Count</li>
  <li>Event Frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we are ranking our groups, calculating <strong>percentile scores</strong> for each dimension seems appropriate. (For example, a membership score of 90 means this group has more members than 90 percent of all other groups).</p>

<p>All that’s left to do now is to calculate the mean percentile scores across all dimensions and declare our winners.</p>

<p><em>So…</em></p>
